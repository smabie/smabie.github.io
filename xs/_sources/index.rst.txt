   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to xs's documentation!
==============================

*xs* is a dynamically typed, dynamically scoped, concatenative array
language inspired by kdb+/q and released into the public domain. The
interpreter and builtin functions are written in OCaml.

The name "xs" either stands for:

1) eXtra Small
2) The plural of "x"

Check out the `project page`_ on github if you wish to browse the
source, open an issue or pull request. *xs* aims to be a small
language with a focus on compactness and expressiveness. Or email me
