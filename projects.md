[xs](/xs/): a dynamically typed, dynamically scoped, concatenative
array language inspired by kdb+/q and released into the public
domain. The interpreter and builtin functions are written in OCaml.

[metaswarm](https://github.com/smabie/metaswarm): a BitTorrent client
written in Scala. Many of the libraries it uses are no longer updated
for Scala 2.13 (much less Scala 3). As such, the client is no longer
maintained.
