title: 'Beta Stability: A New Persistent Factor?'
---

The [beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_(finance)) exposure of a
stock is one of the first and most important statistics any investor
looks at. Though perhaps simplistic, it distills a myriad of various
properties of a stock into a single, easily digestible number. Using
beta, it becomes easy to roughly forecast how an investor\'s portfolio
would perform under different market conditions. Maybe out portfolio has
a beta of 1.3 and we expect the market to return 11% next year: great,
our portfolio should return around 14.3% (1.3\*11%). While there\'s a
lot of problems with this simplistic model, in this post, we\'re going
to focus on just one: the beta of a stock changes significantly over
time. Consider this graph of Apple\'s rolling, 252-day beta:

![AAPL Beta](/assets/aaplbeta.png)

As we can see, the dispersion is quite high, and the rolling beta rarely
stays the same for any reasonable period of time. There could be any
number of reasons for why the rolling beta changes, such as changes in
the drivers of market movements, the evolution of Apple\'s business
model, geographic changes in sales, and etc.

Clearly, some companies are going to have higher beta stability than
others. One might imagine that a mature utility company with stable
recurring revenue would have greater beta stability than a recently
IPO\'d tech company who\'s revenue model and business units are still in
flux. So that brings up the question, when constructing a portfolio,
which kind of companies would we prefer: the relatively unstable beta
company, or the more stable one? In this post, we\'re going to form and
test the hypothesis that, in the long run, a portfolio that consists of
stocks with high beta stability generates excess returns.

The Beta Stable Factor
----------------------

Our goal is to construct a beta neutral long/short portfolio that tries
to capture the abnormal return that we hypothesized might be associated
with a beta stable portfolio. To do this, we\'re going to the *Q500US*
universe provided by [Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/). This
universe consists of the top 500 most liquid (and therefore, probably
largest market cap) equities on any given day. To construct our alpha
factor, we\'re going to use the following equation:

$$f = \text{Z}[\text{rank}(-|\beta_{21}-\beta_{63}|)]$$

Where $\beta_{21}$ is the 21-day (one month) rolling beta, $\beta_{63}$
and the 63-day (three month) rolling beta. We then take the absolute
value, negate, rank, and Z-score. This factor gives us a portfolio that
goes long stocks that have lower changes in beta and shorts those that
have greater changes in beta.

Because we suspect that higher beta stocks tend to have more
instability, we will zero out the beta exposure by dynamically adjusting
our net long exposure. We use the same method that we did in [The Low
Beta Anomaly](https://cryptm.org/posts/2020/06/28/beta.html) post, so go
check it out if you want the details. Backtesting over a 10 year period,
2010-01-01 to 2020-01-01, let\'s first look at our net long exposure:

![Net long exposure](/assets/nl.png)

The reason for our net long exposure being positive is that there is
some correlation between beta instability and high beta stocks. Beta
generally has a right hand skew, so our unadjusted portfolio would have
a higher average beta for the short-side than the long-side. Overall,
this would result in a portfolio that had significant negative beta
exposure, an undesirable property to have in a world where the market
usually goes up. By increasing the long-side of our portfolio, we can
offset the high beta short-side and maintain beta neutrality. Even so,
the net long exposure is relatively small compared to what we observed
for our low beta portfolio (again, to compare, check out [The Low Beta
Anomaly](https://cryptm.org/posts/2020/06/28/beta.html) post): around
10% vs 45%, respectively. This is good, because it means we are
capturing an independent effect with our beta stability hypothesis, not
just another reformulation of the [low beta/volatility
anomaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-volatility_anomaly).

Now for the good part, the cumulative return over the same time period:

![Cumulative Return](/assets/cr.png)

Wow, that looks pretty good for a beta neutral strategy! Let\'s
decompose the returns into quantile:

![Cumulative Return by Quantile](/assets/qcr.png)

This graph shows the cumulative return by quantile if each quantile was
held long (remember that the lower quantiles are held short in our
portfolio). The profit from our strategy comes from the difference
between the upper quantiles and the lower ones. Let\'s look at a table
of metrics to better understand the strategy:

| Metric      | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| Beta        | -.018 |
| Ann. Ret    | 3.56% |
| Ann. Vol    | 2.7%  |
| Ann. Sharpe | 1.28  |

Not bad at all! Our beta minimization worked well, the return is pretty
significant, and our Sharpe ratio is very respectable, at 1.28.

Even so, in an ideal beta neutral strategy, we would want to be making
money off the short-side of the portfolio, not merely hedging our market
risk with it: i.e, we would want to see the lower quantiles lose money,
not merely make less than the greater quantiles. In the next section,
we\'ll consider a long-only variation of the same beta stable strategy.

Long-only Beta Stable
---------------------

For the long-only variation, we\'ll use the same factor as before, but
instead of investing in the entire *Q500US* universe, only invest in the
top 100 stocks. This will give us a portfolio with higher allocations to
stocks with greater beta stability and one with 100% net long exposure.
Using the same time period, consider the quantile graph below:

![Cumulative Return by Quantile](/assets/qcr2.png)

As expected, we only see a small difference of the returns by quantile.
This is because we are only investing in the 100 most stable equities,
significantly narrowing the gap between the lowest and highest quantile.
Still, there is some effect (the first quantile realizes the lowest
returns), which bodes well for the robustness of our factor. Now, for
the moment of truth, our factor portfolio compared with the S&P 500:

![Beta Stable vs S&P 500](/assets/bsvs.png)

Wow! This is an amazing result: over a 10 year period, our factor
portfolio returns a little under a 50% superior return to the S&P

1.  Here\'s a table of metrics for comparison:

| Metric      | Portfolio | S&P 500 |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Beta        | 0.99      | 1.0     |
| Ann. Ret    | 14.7%     | 13.37%  |
| Ann. Vol    | 15.5%     | 14.6%   |
| Ann. Sharpe | 0.94      | 0.91    |

With over a 1% of excess return, a higher Sharpe ratio, and an
equivalent beta, the long-only beta stable strategy appears to be a huge
success!

Conclusion
----------

Based on the results, perhaps we should consider beta stability a new
persistent factor, along with others like low-volatility, value, and
size? This is a bold claim of course, and much more research needs to be
done; but the preliminary results are very positive, especially for the
long-only version. It would be very easy to overlay onto an existing
beta exposure portfolio, generating a moderate amount of excess return
without taking on any more risk. The beta neutral version also has
promise, though ideally it would be combined with other factors (such as
maybe value or low-beta) in order to boost the Sharpe ratio and
unleveraged return.
