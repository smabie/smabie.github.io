title: One Weird Trick to Profit off of a Global Market Meltdown

Did you know there\'s one weird trick that Wall Street doesn\'t want you
to know? For only one payment of \$39.99, you can get access to this
limited time only exclusive video that will show you how to fight that
bear market! Click here before Wall Street makes it illegal... Or you
could just read this post, I guess.

Anyways, when backtesting data I came across an interesting and
surprisingly simple strategy that has performed very well during the
coronavirus period. Simply put, most of the volatility during this
period has occured overnight, that is, between market close and the
opening auction the next day. This volatility has primarily been
negative, with large downward price differences between the closing
price and the opening price the next day. The intraday market on the
otherhand has mostly stayed flat or gone up modestly. Let\'s take a look
at three different portfolios: one where we just hold the S&P 500, the
other where we buy the S&P 500 at market open and sell at market close,
and a third where we do the same but also short the S&P 500 between the
close and market open:

We see that before coronavirus significantly impacts the market, the
returns of all three strategies are relatively similar: little
dispersion is observed in the overnight market and large moves are
primarily contained to the regular intraday session. Around the end of
February, things begin to change: global coronavirus news begins to
dramatically increase the difference between the closing and opening
prices. By executing a strategy as simple as only holding the index
intraday, we convert a 10% loss into a 10% profit, a pretty incredible
difference. Taken one step further, we can even short the overnight
market and net an eye-popping 25% gain over this five and a half month
period!

While the mechanisms for this trend aren\'t entirely clear, I suspect
this pattern occurs when global markets start to exhibit a very high
correlation to each other. Since coronavirus is a global problem, most
markets across the world are being affected by the same fundamental
factors. Because of this, the price difference between the close and
open in the US has been a reflection of moves in the European and Asian
markets: when the foreign markets crash, it\'s highly likely that the
American market will open down in the morning. If, on the otherhand,
coronavirus caused a local recession (imagine if coronavirus was only a
US phenomenon), I suspect that we wouldn\'t see the same overnight
high-volatility trend.

Now, let\'s look at the previous global recession, here\'s the same
graph as before but between 2007-06-01 and 2009-06-01:

We observe the exact same phenomenon, with large moves in the overnight
markets. Even so, much more volatilty was present in the intraday
markets than now: even when using the long intraday, short overnight
strategy we would have still ended up down about 10% over the two year
period. Using our aforementioned hypothesis, this makes sense at the
overnight difference isn\'t as pronounced: the US was the epicenter of
the Great Recession, so the overnight markets are affected comparatively
less than during the current period.

Finally, for contrast, the same strategies during the raging bull market
between 2016-01-01 and 2018-01-01:

Unsurprisingly, both the long intraday and long intraday, short
overnight strategies leave money on the table compared to the vanilla
portfolio. Even so, both net a not so unsubstantial return during this
two year period: the long intraday of around 23% and the long intraday,
short overnight of around 8%.

Conclusion
----------

One last thing to keep in mind is that even with zero comissions, the
act of buying after the open and selling before the close incurs large
trading costs: even assuming you\'re buying large cap stocks with low
spreads (let\'s assume around 4 bips or 0.04%), the annualized cost
comes to around 10% alone!

Even so, shorting or zeroing out overnight exposure can be a powerful
tactic during tumulteous markets: especially if markets around the world
are moving in lockstep. In addition, a small return can be made on top
from the lending of overnight money (though it doesn\'t help that
interest rates are often lowered close to zero during these periods).
