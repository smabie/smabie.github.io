title: 'Analysis of CS:GO Win-rates'

This post is going to be a little different from usual; instead of
markets, we\'re going to look at a video game, namely,[ Counter-Strike:
Global
Offensive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive)
(CS:GO). CS:GO, like most great games, is easy to learn but deceptively
hard to master. For those at are unfamiliar with the game, we\'ll give a
quick overview below.

CS:GO is a competitive zero-sum game in which two teams of 5 players
each try to win rounds. The first team to 16 points wins the game. The
game is asymmetric as there are two distinct sides: the terrorists
(T-side) and counter-terrorists (CT-side). After 15 rounds, each team
switches sides. The goal of the T-side is to either eliminate all CT
players or to plant a bomb and have it explode before the CT-side can
defuse it; the CT-side wins the round if kill all the players on the
T-side before the bomb is planted, if they defuse the bomb, or if time
runs out on the round. this asymmetric rule-set implies that the CT-side
can lose a round even if they kill all the opposing players, while the T
side cannot lose if they eliminate all CT players.

In order to get a better idea of the structure of the game, let\'s look
at a top-down perspective of one of the most famous and iconic maps,
Dust2:

T-side starts the game in T-spawn and must plant their bomb at one of
two locations: B-site or A-site, designated by the red areas on the map.
the CTs start off in CT spawn and must try and defend these two sites.
If T-side manages to break the CT defenses and plant the bomb, the
remaining players on CT try and retake the bombsite (either A or B) and
defuse the bomb before it explodes.

Because of the asymmetric nature of the game, I thought it would be
interesting to analyze how much a kill effects the game for each side.
To start off with, we\'ll first look at the situation where the number
of players on each side is equal.

Even Match-ups
--------------

First up, let\'s look at the so-called even match-up, where there are an
equal number of players on each team: 5v5, 4v4, etc. Using over 400,000
rounds of match data from mid-2018 (click
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/skihikingkevin/csgo-matchmaking-damage)
for the original dataset), we aggregate all rounds with even match-ups
and the side that wins. From this, we can calculate a cumulative win
probability for each match-up:

From the above graph, it\'s seems that the T-side enjoys a significant
advantage. Even when the match starts, the CT-side has a less than 50%
of winning the round and as trades are made (a situation where each team
loses a player), the advantage the T-side has only goes up. But is this
significant? Let\'s look at a table of CT-side win rates and their
associated p-value:

| CT win rate | p-value      | players |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| 0.48729     | 2.67482e-55  | 5       |
| 0.469768    | 1.17974e-151 | 4       |
| 0.455098    | 3.84482e-237 | 3       |
| 0.439982    | 1.52963e-319 | 2       |
| 0.430299    | 2.35914e-282 | 1       |

It\'s clear from the minuscule magnitude of the p-values that we can
reject the null hypothesis, namely that each even match-up is fair: a
50% chance of each side winning the round.

All Match-ups
-------------

Now that we\'ve established that even when each side has the same number
of players the T-side has an advantage, let\'s consider all the possible
combinations. Clearly a situation when 5 CTs are up against 4 Ts is not
a fair fight (We might assume that CTs have the advantage), but unfair
is it? After crunching the number for each permutation, we get the
following graph:

![All Permutations](/assets/csperm.png)

Interesting! When the CTs have close to the number of players as T-side,
the first kills make the most difference. A 5v5 for the CT side gives
them a 48% chance of victory, but netting the first kill shifts the odds
considerably to 68%. When the difference is large, the final kills have
the highest percentage chance, as the chance of the CT-side winning is
so low to start off with. Below is a graph of the exact figures:

| 1 CT       | 2 CT      | 3 CT     | 4 CT     | 5 CT     | \# T alive |
|------------|-----------|----------|----------|----------|------------|
| 0.00218907 | 0.0227307 | 0.106122 | 0.274956 | 0.487288 | 5          |
| 0.00689667 | 0.0682988 | 0.235994 | 0.469768 | 0.683482 | 4          |
| 0.0287596  | 0.187184  | 0.455091 | 0.70026  | 0.858241 | 3          |
| 0.123364   | 0.439972  | 0.732706 | 0.893306 | 0.961373 | 2          |
| 0.430299   | 0.7915    | 0.941975 | 0.985024 | 0.9967   | 1          |
| 0.906434   | 0.989945  | 0.998562 | 0.999731 | 0.999873 | 0          |

Conclusions
-----------

I know little about professional CS:GO strategy and the data isn\'t
taken from professional games, but we can quickly infer a couple things
from the data:

1.  T-side wants to trade down as much as possible, CT never wants to
    trade.
2.  CT-side needs to be play very conservative, maximizing the number of
    players on their team that are alive.
3.  T-side wants to play in a very aggressive style in order to take map
    control and trade.
