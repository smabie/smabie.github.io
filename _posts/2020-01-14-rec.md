Introduction
------------

In today\'s post, we will dig into the nature and value of analyst
recommendations in order to try to answer an old but controversial
question: do sell-side analyst recommendations hold any predictive
power; and if so, when and why? The data we will use for this analysis
is the *FactSet Estimates - Broker Recommendations* dataset, available
free of charge on Quantopian.

Background
----------

Analyst recommendations and letters are as old as Wall Street itself:
traditionally provided as free reports for a broker or investment
bank\'s buy-side institutional clients. A bank might employ many
different equity analysts, each focusing and covering a basket of
stocks, usually all in the same sector. In addition to publishing
qualitative reports, a quantitative numerical score is also provided.
While different firms have adopted different rating systems, all ratings
in the FactSet dataset have been normalized according to the following
table:

| Rating | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 1      | Buy         |
| 1.5    | Overweight  |
| 2      | Hold        |
| 2.5    | Underweight |
| 3      | Sell        |

As analyst ratings and reports are provided as a free auxiliary service,
they act as a value-add for the firm\'s brokerage and trading desks
instead of a primary and monetizable product. In the best light, the
recommendations act to inform or supplement the firm\'s clients\' views
of a given stock instead of defining it. The more contrarian and
critical view is that the recommendations are little more than
entertainment and exist entirely to drive trading activity for the firm.
After all, how much predictive power could these ratings actually have?
If the equity analyst did indeed have any alpha, why would they be
working at a sell-side firm publishing reports instead of trading with
their own money or at a buy-side investment firm? A third possible
explanation is that the very existence of the ratings, especially from
so called all-star analysts, manage to move the market, in effect
becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.

From the theoretical viewpoint of the *Efficient Market Hypothesis*
(EMH), the value of analyst ratings is clear: since analysts are not
incorporating any genuinely new or unique information into their reports
and ratings, they should not have any predictive power. In this view,
reading public filings and listening in on earning calls cannot possibly
help, since this information gets quickly absorbed into the market
price, thus rapidly rendering the ratings useless. In addition, the very
existence of the ratings themselves cannot affect the value since no
rational investor would trade on information already incorporated into
the price. Despite the intellectual appeal, this strong EMH has become
niche over the years as the mania of the market has become more apparent
with the advent of the dotcom boom/bust and the great recession.

While the academic and professional consensus is still unclear, there
does seem to be evidence in the literature that analyst recommendations
do hold some predictive power. In [Hemang Desai, Bing Liang & Ajai K.
Singh
(2019)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2469/faj.v56.n3.2357),
the authors find a number of interesting effects: 1) all-star analysts
outperformed their peers 2) there seems to be major herding behavior
among analysts

1.  analysts who only cover one sector have better predictive power than

those who are responsible for covering multiple sectors. In [Brad
Barber, Reuven Lehavy, Maureen McNichols and Brett Trueman
(2002)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/0022-1082.00336),
the authors construct a long/short market-neutral portfolio based on
analysts\' recommendations and realize a 4% annualized return on the
portfolio.

As suggested by the aforementioned papers, it is possible that *some*
analysts have *some* predictive power, but the caveats are long and
many: How do we tell the good analysts from the bad? In what market
conditions are the ratings likely to be correct? With such strong
herding behavior, how independent are each rating? What does the actual
scale mean, and how do we know, for example, that \"hold\" means the
same thing for all analysts? The questions go on and on, muddying the
waters significantly. In the next section, we will construct a
long/short market neutral portfolio in an attempt to try to answer the
fundamental and basic question on everyone\'s mind: can I make money
from analyst recommendations?

Using Analyst Recommendations, the Simple Way
---------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, the FactSet data available on Quantopian is somewhat
limited, containing only 8 relevant fields:

| Name     | Description                           |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| `buy`    | number of buy recommendations         |
| `over`   | number of overweight recommendations  |
| `under`  | number of underweight recommendations |
| `sell`   | number of sell recommendations        |
| `total`  | total number of recommendations       |
| `mark`   | average recommendation                |
| `no_rec` | number of missing recommendations     |

We don\'t have access to individual analyst recommendation in this data
sets, and therefore will not be able to pick up when an individual
analyst changes her recommendation. To start off with, we will just
simply be using the `mark` field to construct our alpha factor. We
construct our market-neutral factor based on the following equation:

$$f=\text{Z}(\text{rank}[-mark])$$

We take the negative of the `mark` field since 1 is a buy and we want to
long positive ratings and short negative ones. We then rank from 1 to
$n$, with $n$ being the most highly recommended stock. After that we
Z-score in order to fit the data into the standard normal distribution.
For our universe we\'ll use `Q500US`, which is comprised of the 500 most
liquid securities using a 200-day average dollar volume, capped at a max
of 30% of equities in any single sector. We set our start date at
2003-01-01 with an end date of 2019-01-01, though, ideally, we would
save more data for out-of-sample testing.

To start out, let\'s break up our data into quantiles and look at the 1
day, 5 day, and 10 day holding periods to get a better sense of the
distribution of returns between quantiles and the persistence or decay
of alpha over these periods:

![Mean Return by Quantile](/assets/recq.png)

Immediately from this graph, we can see that things are not looking so
good for the analyst recommendations. Ideally we would see a
monotonically increasing return stream as we move from the lowest to the
highest quantile. Since we are shorting all equities in the lawer half
and longing in the upper half, we are losing money in every single
quantile across all holding periods. Digging deeper, let\'s look at the
cumulative return by quantile for the 1 day holding period:

![Cumulative Return by Quantile](/assets/reccret.png)

In general, we want the 4th and 5th quantiles to be steadily climbing
upward while quantiles 1 and 2 steadily decline. Except for a brief
period around the financial crisis, we see the opposite. Putting it all
together, let\'s finally look at the entire long/short portfolio\'s
cumulative return stream:

![Cumulative Return](/assets/recret.png)

Unsurprisingly (after seeing the previous graphs), the portfolio does
not perform exceptionally well over this time period, only making
significant gains during the financial crisis and then giving them up
(and more) shortly after the start of 2009. While reading time-series
graphs of this nature is often akin to reading tea-leaves, we can
tentatively hazard a few explanations for the apparent lack of
predictive power in the analyst ratings:

1.  Perhaps during turbulent market conditions, analysts ratings exhibit
    higher predictive value than in less volatile environments. In these
    market regimes, analysts might exhibit less herding behavior as the
    consequence of being objectively wrong (instead of merely
    contrarian) becomes more severe. Or put more simply, analysts may
    get fired for being wrong in bad times while fired for being
    contrarian in good times.

2.  In [T. Clifton
    Green (2009)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-financial-and-quantitative-analysis/article/value-of-client-access-to-analyst-recommendations/AEE68658A8841D8A2862BDC462A38B2C),
    Green finds systematic mispricing for only two hours after a new
    recommendation is released. Quantopian only started storing the
    FactSet dataset in a point-in-time fashion starting November 2018;
    for data before then, the timestamp is approximated, thus
    potentially leading to the situation where all the alpha has been
    traded away before the backtester has access to it.

3.  In [Christophe, Stephen & Ferri, Michael & Hsieh,
    Jim (2010)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46489709_Informed_Trading_Before_Analyst_Downgrades_Evidence_From_Short_Sellers),
    the authors uncover evidence of abnormal and unusual levels of
    short-selling in the three days before analyst downgrades are
    announced. This might suggest that individuals and firms are trading
    on inside information obtained from analyst recommendations before
    their official public release, reducing or eliminating any alpha our
    strategy can capture.

Whatever the case, using the data available, there unfortunately does
not seem to be a persistent abnormal return associated with the
portfolio. There is however one hopeful statistic that indicates there
could possibly be some value in analyst ratings, the /Information
Coefficient/(IC) value:

![Information Coefficient Distribution](/assets/ic.png)

The IC is a measure of predictive power, or the correlation between the
expected or predicted return and the realized forward return bounded
between -1 and 1. An IC of 0 indicates no edge, that is, there is no
relationship between the expected return and the forward return. A value
of 1 indicates a perfect correlation between the two, while -1 means
that the prediction is always incorrect. Despite the strategy yielding
no cumulative abnormal return, the mean IC is, albeit slightly,
positive; thus implying that the predictive power of analyst
recommendations is better than random.

Using Analyst Recommendations Conditioned on Returns
----------------------------------------------------

It is clear that using just analyst ratings is not sufficient to
generate and sustain abnormal returns. It might be helpful to go back
and remember what *exactly* we are trying to do by using analyst
ratings: we are trying to find predictive information that has not yet
been incorporated into the price of the equity. Put a slightly different
but similar way, we are looking for an expert minority view not shared
by the rest of the market. It might stand to reason, for example, that
if the stock is going up and the average analyst recommendation is a
buy, then either the buy rating has already been priced in or analysts
don\'t possess a significantly different outlook on the stock than the
rest of the market. On the other-hand, if the stock has an average
rating of buy but the stock is declining in price then it stands to
reason that the analysts hold a (presumably) expert minority opinion
that is not shared by the rest of the market yet. Below is a table
illustrating the four primary conditions and the corresponding actions
based on the aforementioned hypothesis:

| Recommendation | Direction | Action    |
|----------------|-----------|-----------|
| Buy            | Up        | No Action |
| Sell           | Down      | No Action |
| Buy            | Down      | Long      |
| Sell           | Up        | Short     |

We can easily construct the corresponding factor as follows:

$$f=\text{Z}(\text{rank}[-mark]-\text{rank}[\text{SMA}_{20}(r_{daily})])$$

Where $\text{SMA}_{20}$ is the 20 day simple moving average and
$r_{daily}$ the daily (close-to-close) returns. This factor will allows
us to create a market-neutral portfolio that longs stocks that have had
poor last month returns but positive analyst ratings while shorting
stocks that have had good returns and negative ratings. As like before,
let\'s start off by looking at the daily mean returns by quantile:

![Mean Return by Quantile](/assets/arecret.png)

Though not monotonic and far from perfect, it looks a lot better! It\'s
clear that our alpha decays rather quickly, so let\'s focus on the one
day holding period\'s cumulative return by quantile:

![Cumulative Return by Quantile](/assets/areccret.png)

Again, not terrible: we see the upper quantiles move steadily upward
while the lower quantiles move steadily downward. Now for the total
long/short cumulative return chart and IC:

![Cumulative Return](/assets/arectret.png)

![Information Coefficient Distribution](/assets/aic.png)

From the IC and cumulative returns, it is clear that the portfolio
constructed from the above factor possesses abnormal return (for a a
market-neutral portfolio, any return greater than zero could be
considered abnormal). Even though this is an absolute return strategy
(i.e it has no comparable benchmark), it\'s illustrative to compare with
the S&P 500 as many investors will implicitly benchmark all strategies
to vanilla market returns:

| Metric   | L/S  | S&P 500 |
|----------|------|---------|
| Beta     | 6.3% | 100%    |
| Ann. Ret | 1.9% | 8.4%    |
| Ann. Vol | 6.8% | 17.6%   |
| Ret/Vol  | 0.29 | 1.24    |

Unfortunately, after looking at the above table, it is clear that even
though our strategy demonstrates abnormal returns, investors would not
find it an attractive investment. The unlevered return is below the
cost-of-capital (i.e risk-free rate) so it would be difficult to lever
up the strategy in order to increase returns. Even if we could borrow at
a zero percent interest rate, it is unclear why would even want to as
the S&P 500 has a better return to volatility ratio over this
time-period; in other words, an investor could just invest a third of
their money in the S&P 500 and receive both better returns and
volatility than our strategy. Perhaps the only saving grace is the low
market (beta) exposure, but with so many other uncorrelated asset
classes that have much better risk/reward profiles, the strategy is
functionally useless.

Conclusion
----------

Predicated on the above analysis, it can be reasonably concluded that
there is predictive information in analyst recommendations and that real
value is being provided to clients on behalf of brokers. Nonetheless,
using analyst recommendations in aggregate to outperform in the equities
market is difficult and complex.
